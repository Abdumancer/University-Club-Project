Things to know for this project<br>There are two user types in the project:

1. Student 2. Admin

After logging in, the student can view the clubs they have created and joined from their home page and the events they will attend. 

They can view the clubs from the clubs page or send a request to the admin to create a club.

They can click the view club button and join the club, declare that they will attend the events, and view the club events and members. 

The student can only create events in the clubs they have joined

When an event is to be created, the club owner must first approve, and after the club owner approves, the admin must approve from the admin panel.

The club owner and admins can remove members from the club, view who will attend the events in the club, and delete events.

Administrators have additional rights:

Views all users and makes any user an admin

Views all clubs and has the same rights over clubs as club owners.

Views all events and has the right to make changes.

Views club and event requests


Has the right to accept or reject these requests

Can view statistics.


Note: I used Laravel version 5.8, XAMPP control panel v3.2.4 Apache and MySQL modules for this project.
